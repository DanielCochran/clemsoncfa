- The file structure is fairly simple for the CFA management system.

template directory
 - holds the main layout of the page
 
includes directory
 - holds db connection string, change here and it will change throughout
 
modules directory 
- holds 99% of database interactions..for a given page, it most likely has a page called getXXXX.php that handles all of its database calls

root of public_html
- holds the main pages for the site, most of them include template.php and call the corresponding template depending on how you want the page displayed

misc..
- the databases are simple and dirty..nothing above 1NF in there.

To whomever comes behind me to work on this site, you're welcome for this brief overview..email and let me know if someone actually reads this ;)
